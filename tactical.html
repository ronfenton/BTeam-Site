            <H1>Matrix: Gameplay</H1>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Matrix Elements</h2>
                <p>Every matrix-relevant entity is represented by an Icon.</p>
                <p>Icons within 100m or within the same host as you are automatically visible unless hidden.</p>
                <p>
                    The primary icon types are Persona (User + Device Combined), Device (Physical Object), File, and
                    Host (Matrix Environment).
                </p>
                <p>A single character can only have one persona at any time.</p>
                <p>
                    Most icons are visible by default, with security, monitoring, and of course sneaky people being
                    hidden by running silently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The appearance of an Icon is restricted by its type; Form suggests Function. Guns must look like
                    weapons, vehicles like modes of transportation, etc. Hackers can break this rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Commlinks will automatically hide uninteresting icons if desired, such as those far away, unrelated
                    to the user's interests, within a PAN, or filtered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Matrix has no concern for facing or line of sight; however users perceive most of the matrix
                    through vision. Users are free to decide how icons out of vision appear; most commonly as HUD-like
                    notifications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noise between devices can be caused by Distance, Spam, Lack of Infrastructure, or even Intentional
                    Design.
                </p>
                <p>If an Agent is running on the same device as a User; it forms a second persona of its own.</p>
                <p>
                    Marks are personal to the persona that placed them, and are placed on icons. They are small, and
                    identifiable, but 'hidden' within the icon so marked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Marks provide access to an icon's features or data. Most marks are legal and are <em>invited</em> by
                    the owner of the icon. Hackers abuse this by putting unsolicited marks on icons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    PANs (Personal Area Networks) can be created easily to have a single device (usually a commlink,
                    deck, or RCC) serve as a master to a number of lesser devices. This lets these other devices use the
                    master's better statistics.
                </p>
                <p>If a slave is marked, the master is also marked.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Grids</h2>
                <p>
                    Every icon outside of a host is running on a Grid. Grids you have legal access to are defined by
                    your Lifestyle.
                </p>
                <p>Devices on different grids are visible, but harder to hack.</p>
                <p>
                    Everyone can access the Public Grid, but this grid sucks. Most people use various Local, National,
                    or Corporate Grids.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Hosts</h2>
                <p>
                    Hosts are Separate from Grids; you cannot see Icons inside a Host from the Grid, or vice-versa.
                    Basic communication still works however.
                </p>
                <p>Only Personas can enter Hosts; however devices can be slaved to them as WANs.</p>
                <p>
                    Hosts are not physically based, but matrix based, and thus suffer no noise or distance limitation to
                    access or while inside; however any penalty to access the matrix as a whole (Public Grid,
                    Physically-Based Noise, etc) still apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When inside a host, you are directly connected to all devices slaved to that host and all icons
                    inside that host; but lose connection to all Icons outside of that host, excepting only the device
                    that is hosting your Persona and any files or programs on that device.
                </p>
                <p>WANs (Wide Area Networks) work as PANs, but are specifically for devices slaved to hosts.</p>
                <p>
                    The protection of PANs and WANs can be subverted by direct connection, forcing the device to only
                    use its own defences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slaved devices on your PAN lose PAN protection when you enter a host; you can't interact with them
                    or provide them protection anymore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, one can expect one host per related infrastructure or building; with occasionally a
                    second where separation between public and private/security are required †.
                </p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>AR Relevant Only</h2>
                <p>
                    AROs (Augmented Reality Objects) are additions to the AR environment, overlaid over reality. They
                    can take many forms from advertisements to fashion overlays and graffiti. AROs are transparent / out
                    of the way enough to cause only minor distractions.
                </p>
                <p>Matrix users can create their own AROs and share them however they desire.</p>
                <p>
                    ARO visibility is controlled by the ARO and the Grid firstly; ARO Spam Zones can be common and AROs
                    are frequently used to hide or mask physical phenomena, though users can hide AROs they find
                    disruptive or annoying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interacting with AR is limited by the user's tools. An Image Link is needed to see in AR, a Sound
                    Link is needed to hear in AR, AR-Gloves are required to feel AROs, etc. A DNI provides all senses
                    and feedback, while a Sim Module allows someone to experience non-standard sensations; such as those
                    from another person or VR.
                </p>
                <p>AROs can also appear in VR, useful for communicating data between VR and AR users †.</p>
                <p>
                    While AROs are typically non-obstructive, users can voluntarily make them more intense. This is
                    common for AR-Based entertainment events; and is how AR-Fashion and similar tools work. in these
                    cases, AROs can be useful distractions, concealment, or tools. †
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>VR Relevant Only</h2>
                <p>
                    Using VR requires a Direct Neural Interface (DNI), such as from a Datajack or Trodes, and a sim
                    module.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Icon size is guided - Persona are between dwarf and troll, devices smaller, files & programs even
                    smaller;
                    hosts are large.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of hosts, the Matrix appears as a vague projection of the world; hosts floating above in the
                    air and sky. This is further modified by your Grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside hosts can vary heavily; host design freedom rules. Fully virtual environments are possible.
                    Despite this, Host VR interiors are entirely decorative - Icons behind 'walls' are still visible,
                    and a Patrol IC 'on another floor' can still see you and scan you.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Device Ownership</h2>
                <p>
                    All icons have an Owner. The owner of a device is a user or corporation, this information is stored
                    on the device itself and a Matrix Registry with some mysterious derived identifier involving login
                    credentials and the device's own data. All other icons are owned by a Persona, serving as a Matrix
                    identity for the user or corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Device or Host can have only one owner; however ownership authority may be deferred (and is common
                    for Security Spiders and Riggers, and company equipment). Deferred authority has all perks of
                    ownership, except the ability to change ownership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stealing a device as such is difficult; an individual with high skill in hardware needs to modify a
                    device's architecture <em>and</em> its generation of ownership credentials to a new user, a process
                    requiring constant connection to the Matrix Registry, ensuring the entire time the device's original
                    owner can still track or locate the device during the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Devices used by employees are rarely fully owned by the employee, and are instead owned by the
                    corporation employing them. As such, most employees can neither transfer ownership under duress; and
                    killing the employee does little to prevent the owner tracking a given item.
                </p>
                <p>A device's ownership can be changed intentionally by the owner in a process taking only one minute.

                <h2>Common Interactions</h2>
                <p>
                    Matrix Perception is used to observe information. Roll <em>Computer + Intuition [Data
                        Processing]</em>. Each hit lets the user ask one question with one answer like 'what is the
                    rating of that device', 'does this icon have a databomb on it', 'is there a silently running icon
                    within 100m', 'is that device affected by Wrapper', 'how many devices are in a given area'. Note
                    that this <em>can</em> be used to try locate devices by narrowing an area over and over, following
                    data-trails to their source †. This is slower and less effective than just using Trace Icon however,
                    and icons running silently have hidden such trails †.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It can also be used to actually spot a device running silently once you know there is one. This is a
                    <em>Computer + Intuition [Data Processing]</em> vs <em>Logic + Sleaze</em> test. This will target
                    one random silent running device;
                    however you can limit this if you provide criteria (EG; 'that drone right there I know that's
                    running silent' or 'a commlink / persona / etc')
                </p>
                <p>
                    Send Message can be used to send a message to a different icon such as an ally's commlink. This
                    generic action requires no test can be used for any sort of information sharing; from sending a
                    short message (or a long paragraph if you've got a DNI!) or a file, to showing a live feed from any
                    recording equipment.

                <h2>Devices and Wireless</h2>
                <p>
                    Most equipment has benefits when set to wireless. Without special equipment, acquiring these bonuses
                    requires the item to be wireless enabled, making them valid targets for Matrix Perception and
                    hacking efforts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A device can be set to run silently, this confers a -2 on all Matrix Actions performed with that
                    device. It may also impart other small penalties to the device's use due to the added burden, at GM
                    Discretion †.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Devices that are running silently are not automatically detected by those using the Matrix in some
                    way.
                </p>
                <p>If a device's wireless setting is disabled, it can only be hacked by direct physical connection.</p>
                <p>All devices have a device rating between 1 - 6, with common items as follows.</p>

                    You can count how many marks are on you with a matrix perception hit, though you won't recognize
                    them if you aren't familiar with the persona that put them there.

                <p>
                    Rebooting a device removes all marks, both those you have placed on others, and those from others on
                    your own device.
                </p>
                <p>The owner of a device effectively always has four marks on the device.</p>
                <p>You can only place up to three marks on a device that isn't yours.</p>
                <p>
                    Owners of devices or hosts can invite marks to legally receive marks from others (such as to provide
                    access or defer authority).

                <p>
                    Transferring ownership of a device involuntarily requires an extended *Hardware + Logic [Mental]
                    (24, 1 hour)* test, and the device must be online at all times.
                </p>
                <p>Changing ownership of a device voluntarily takes one minute.</p>
                <p>
                    Changing ownership of any other icon is generally impossible; however creating a copy of a file will
                    create a copy you own and the original can then be deleted.

                The rules here are of interest to specific types of matrix characters or entities, such as
                Technomancers, Deckers, Riggers and AI. Most people can ignore this.

                <h2>Overwatch</h2>
                <p>
                    As matrix personas perform illegal actions, their Overwatch Score begins to increase. For every hit
                    rolled on any enemy resistance test against an illegal action, the Persona's Overwatch Score will
                    increase by that same amount; additionally, every 15 minutes after performing your first illegal
                    action, your overwatch score increases by 2D6. Deckers do not know their Overwatch Score. If
                    Overwatch ever reaches 40, Convergence will occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Convergence is a bad thing - if on a Grid, the Grid Overwatch Division immediately hits your persona
                    for 12DV Matrix Damage (resistable), and force-reboots your persona, potentially causing dumpshock.
                    Your physical location is also reported to the owner of the Grid you're on. If you're in a Host, you
                    instead immediately receive 3 Marks from the host and if the host hadn't already - starts deploying
                    IC. Leaving a host during Convergence causes the Grid Convergence - so best to just directly leave
                    the matrix while in the host rather than leave the host first.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Intrusion Countermeasures have ratings equal to the Host's rating, and perform all actions with a DP
                    of Rating x2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One IC can be deployed each combat turn by the host, and can run an amount of simultaneous IC
                    programs equal to its Host rating, but no more than 1 of the same kind at any time. Disrupting an IC
                    does not prevent the Host from deploying a new one of the same type.

                    Deckers have multiple actions at their disposal, though require a device with Sleaze or Attack
                    attributes to perform them - Decks have both, and are the most common tool for this. Decker actions
                    fall into four categories. Actions in each category use their corresponding matrix attribute as a
                    limit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data Processing actions are legal and use the device's Data Processing or Device Rating as a limit.
                    As these are legal, failed actions have no consequence, and successful ones are often silent.

                    a failed attack action causes the attacker to have to resist damage equal to the defender's net hits
                    but does not notify the owner. Attack actions use the device's Attack score only as a limit.

                    Sleaze actions are illegal. A successful sleaze action is entirely unnoticed; a failed one alerts
                    the owner, and gives the owner 1 mark on the sleazing device. Sleaze actions use the device's Sleaze
                    score only as a limit.

            <h1>Magic: Mechanics</h1>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Spellcasting</h2>
                <p>
                    Spells are cast using Spellcasting + Magic [Force], as a Complex Action. Resisting a spell is based
                    on the category that the spell falls into.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After casting a spell, the caster resists drain as appropriate for the spell and its drain code
                    (Usually Force +/- X). Drain code can be reduced below 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drain Resistance is LOG + WIL for Hermetic, and CHA + WIL for Shamanic. Other traditions may have a
                    different test for resisting Drain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If your hits (limited by Force) are greater than your Magic, drain is Physical. Otherwise, it is
                    Stun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Physical Spells can affect any physical object; Mana Spells can only affect living targets on the
                    same plane you're on.
                </p>
                <p>Sustained Spells infer -2 to all Spellcasting tests per spell.</p>
                <p>Reckless Spellcasting: Lets you cast spells as a Simple action, but increases drain code by +3.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Targeting</h2>
                <p>
                    LOS Spells only work on targets visible through natural or essence-paid optics. Reflections &
                    Refraction is OK;
                    digital screens are not. Vision modifiers apply as dice pool penalties.
                </p>
                <p>T Spells require physical contact, such as performed by an unarmed combat skill.</p>
                <p>Area spells have a radius equal to (Force)m unless mentioned otherwise.</p>
                <p>Physical spells can only target things that exist in the Physical World</p>
                <p>Mana spells can only target living things on the same plane(s) as yourself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Spell Type Rules</h2>
                <p>Combat</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Direct spells are resisted by BOD (Physical) or WIL (Mana); and deals damage equal to net-hits
                        directly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Indirect spells are resisted as a ranged attack, using REA + INT. DV = Force + Net Hits; AP =
                        -(Force). Damage is resisted as normal (BOD + Adjusted Armour).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Indirect Area Spells work as Grenades with Scatter and a threshold of (3). Net hits still
                        increase damage after the (3). Hits less than this reduce scatter.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Detection</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Range for detection spells is equal to Force x MAG for standard range, and Force x MAG x 10 for
                        Extended.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        More Hits confers more information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Active senses are opposed by WIL + LOG [Mental] for living, (Force x 2) for Magical Objects, or
                        Object Resistance. Counterspelling applies even if unaware. If multiple people are affected,
                        each rolls against the same Spellcasting Test to resist detection individually.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Passive senses work as standard senses and permit the use of Perception tests; though these
                        tests are limited to [Force].
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Health</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Essence Loss serves as a dice pool penalty to receive Health spells equal to the ceiling of (Max
                        ESS - Current ESS).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Illusion</p>
                <ul>

                    As a free action or an interrupt (-5) action, you can provide protection to yourself and up to (MAG)
                    Allies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This gives you an amount of Counterspelling Die equal to your Counterspelling Skill (do not include

                </p>
                <p>
                    Any time a spell affects you or your protected allies, you can allocate some of these die to give
                    them a bonus to their resistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If multiple people are affected by the same spell, this bonus die applies to everyone (eg; spending
                    1
                    die gives everyone +1 DP).

                    The appearance of these spirits is influenced by the character's tradition. A Hermetic fire spirit

                <p>
                    Each net hit reduces available services by 1. If this reaches 0, the spirit departs. Take drain

                    Until the spirit departs, this Spirit can be 'summoned' to earn services, even if that spirit cannot
                    usually be controlled by that tradition.

                    Based on your weapon's fire types available, you've got the following options. This influences
                    rounds
                    fired, and penalty on enemy defence.
                </p>
                <p>Firing more than 1 round incurs a recoil penalty.</p>
                <p>
                    You have Recoil Compensation equal to 1 + (ST/3) + Weapon's Recoil Comp or 1 + Vehicle/Drone Body +
                    Weapon's Recoil Comp. The penalty is equal to Rounds Fired - Recoil Compensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The amount of rounds fired increases every action until you spend a simple action not firing (such
                    as

                <p>
                    If the DV of an attack is less than the rating of Hardened Armour (after Applying AP); the attack is
                    entirely negated. Even if not negated, the armour still provides 1 free hit per 2 points of Hardened
                    Armour (after AP) Apply Hardened Armour first in cases of multiple armour sources.

                <p>
                    Vehicles cannot receive Stun Damage, and thus any damage less than their Armor rating is negated
                    entirely.
